Problem Title: Finding Slope
============================

Code filename: finding_slope.cpp

The following problem is a simplified version of a more generalized map-reading challenge. This problem will solve the challenge in 2D as opposed to the generalized 3D situation.

Fiona is planning on going hiking and she wants to look up the steepness of the trail at various points. She has received a data file with elevations along the hiking trail. The data file contains 1000 data points. Each measurement is an elevation in meters, taken one meter apart.

The input file name is "trail_elevations.txt". Data was obtained from https://ridewithgps.com/routes/5467983 on February 27, 2018.

Write a program that allows the user to enter a distance in meters from the start of the trail. The program will then tell the user the slope of the trail before and after that point in the trail. Note that positive slope means an upward slope and a negative slope means a downward slope.

### Sample Output

Sample run 1

    Enter the distance (in meters) along the trail where
    you would like to find the slope (between 1 and 998 meters): 1
    The slope before the given point is 1.0
    The slope after the given point is 0.6

Sample run 2

    Enter the distance (in meters) along the trail where
    you would like to find the slope (between 1 and 998 meters): 998
    The slope before the given point is 2.5
    The slope after the given point is 3.7

Sample run 3

    Enter the distance (in meters) along the trail where
    you would like to find the slope (between 1 and 998 meters): 101
    The slope before the given point is -6.2
    The slope after the given point is -2.0
