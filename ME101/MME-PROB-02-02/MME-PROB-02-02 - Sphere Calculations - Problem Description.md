Problem Title: Sphere Calculations
==================================

Code filename: sphere_calculations.cpp

Write a program that inputs the radius of two spheres. The unit of measurement for the input radius is yards.

The program must output the radius (in meters), surface area (in meters-squared), and volume (in meters-cubed) for both spheres. The format of the output should match the table format given in the Sample Output, especially the column headings and row headings.

### Sample Input

    Enter the radius of sphere 1 in yards: 7
    Enter the radius of sphere 2 in yards: 9

### Sample Output

                           *Sphere 1*        *Sphere 2*
    radius [m] :               6.4008            8.2296
    surface area [m^2] :      514.847           851.074
    volume [m^3] :            1098.48           2334.67
