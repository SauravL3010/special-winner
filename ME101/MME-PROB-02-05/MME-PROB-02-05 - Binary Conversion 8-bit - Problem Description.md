Problem Title: Binary Conversion
=================================

Code filename: binary_conversion.cpp

Fatima would like some assistance converting decimal numbers to their binary form.

As Fatima is not experienced with using if statements or loops, she is asking that you refrain from using either of these constructs within your code. You can assume that the decimal number entered is between 0 and 255 inclusive.

Write a program to input a decimal number and then outputs the binary form of the number.

### Sample Output

    Please enter a decimal number to convert to binary: 189
    The number in binary form is: 10111101

### Time Target

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Time to Complete </th>
    <th> Rating </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Less than 10 minutes </th>
    <th> \* \* \* </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> 10 to 15 minutes </th>
    <th> \* \* </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> More than 15 minutes </th>
    <th> \* </th>
  </tr>
</table>
