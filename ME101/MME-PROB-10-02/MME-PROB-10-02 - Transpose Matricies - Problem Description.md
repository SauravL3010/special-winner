Problem Title: Transpose Matrices
=================================

Code filename: transpose_matrix.cpp

David had some data entered in some text files in table format, but erroneously switched rows and columns. In order to fix the problem, he needs to transpose the data matrix.

The data is contained in a file called matrix_data.txt. The first two numbers in the file indicate the size of the matrix by the number of rows and the number of columns respectively. The maximum number of rows is 20 and the maximum number of columns is 50. This is followed by the data in matrix form, separated by spaces. All the data are integer values.

Write a program to read the data from the file and output the data after it has been transposed.

### Sample Input

    3
    5
    10 9 3 2 0
    6 1 0 3 0
    2 0 0 3 0

### Sample Output

    10 6 2
    9 1 0
    3 0 0
    2 3 3
    0 0 0

### Time Target

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Time to Complete </th>
    <th> Rating </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Less than 7 minutes </th>
    <th> \* \* \* </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> 7 to 10 minutes </th>
    <th> \* \* </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> More than 10 minutes </th>
    <th> \* </th>
  </tr>
</table>
