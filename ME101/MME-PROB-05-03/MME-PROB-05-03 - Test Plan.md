Problem Title: First Do-While Loop
==================================

### all_valid.py

Both numbers are odd positive integers.

### first_entry_even.py

Try an even positive number once for both numbers. Check that the repeat prompt exactly matches the first prompt.

Try a negative number once for both numbers. Check that the repeat prompt exactly matches the first prompt.

### first_entry_negative.py

Try an even positive number and then a negative number for both numbers. Check that the repeat prompts exactly match the first prompt.

### many_invalids.py

Try 50 to 100 invalid inputs for each of the numbers.

### uses_do_while.py

Check the code uses two do-while loops. Count 'do's is two. Count 'while's is two.

# Possible variations or erroneous approches

* uses two while loops instead of do-while loops
* uses one while loop and one do-while loop
* uses one do-while loop and one while loop
* uses two for loops instead of do-while loops
