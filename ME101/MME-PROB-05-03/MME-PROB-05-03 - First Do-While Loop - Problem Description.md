Problem Title: First Do-While Loop
==================================

Code filename: first_do_while.cpp

Don is looking for your assistance to add two integers together, but only if they are odd and positive. Your program should prompt the user to enter an odd number. If the number is not odd or not positive, the program should repeat the same prompt and have the user enter another number. You can assume that the user will always enter an integer. Repeat this process for the second integer, until the user has entered both odd integers.

Output the sum of the two integers.

### Sample Output 1

    This program will add two odd positive integers.
    Enter the first odd positive integer: 7
    Enter the second odd positive integer: 9
    The sum of the entered numbers is 16.

### Sample Output 2

    This program will add two odd positive integers.
    Enter the first odd positive integer: 8
    Enter the first odd positive integer: 4
    Enter the first odd positive integer: 1
    Enter the second odd positive integer: -9
    Enter the second odd positive integer: 3
    The sum of the entered numbers is 4.
