Problem Title: Balance Part 1
=============================

Code filename: balance_1.cpp

David is at the playground with his daughter, playing on a see-saw. His daughter would like to balance the see-saw. The seats for the see-saw are 1.6 meters from the fulcrum.

Write a program to calculate the distance from the fulcrum where David would need to sit in order to balance the see-saw, assuming his daughter sits in a seat at the end of the see-saw. The user should be prompted to enter David's daughter's weight and David's weight. Output the distance from the fulcrum where David would need to sit in order to balance the see-saw.
