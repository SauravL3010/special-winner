Problem Title: Factorial Function
=====================================

Code filename: factorial.cpp

In this exercise, you are going to write a standalone function. The Marmoset test system will provide its own int main() code in order to run the function that you write. Write your function within a file called factorial.cpp and submit it to Marmoset.

Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer. The function must be named 'factorial' and return a value of type long long. Use the following function header:

    long long factorial(int n_factorial) { }

Make sure that you do not include a main() function as part of your submission. You may wish to use a main() function in order to test your code. If you do so, then simply comment out that code before submitting it to Marmoset for grading.
