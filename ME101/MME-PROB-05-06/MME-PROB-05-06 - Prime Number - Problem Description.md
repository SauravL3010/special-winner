Problem Title: Prime Number
================================

Code filename: prime_number.cpp

David would like your assistance with figuring out whether a number is prime or not.

If the number is not a prime, use the keyword 'composite' in the program's output. If the number is prime, use the keyword 'prime' in the program's output.

Remember that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. Due to the intricacies of the mathematics, only numbers greater than 1 will be inputted.



### Sample Output 1

    Enter the number to check if prime: 323
    
    The number is a composite number.

### Sample Output 2

    Enter the number to check if prime: 11
    
    The number is a prime number.

### Sample Output 3

    Enter the number to check if prime: 1223
    
    The number is a prime number.
