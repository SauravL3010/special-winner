Problem Title: Secret Message
=============================

Code filename: secret_message.cpp

Carol needs to send a secret message to Mike. She has placed the secret message in a file called secret_message.txt. Each line of the file contains a word, followed by the location index of that word. If you reorder the words according to their location index, you will reconstruct the original message. The location indices start at 0. The message is guaranteed to be less than 100 words long.

Output the original message to the console.

For your own testing purposes, three sample test files are provided:
* secret_message.txt
* secret_message_2.txt
* secret_message_3.txt
